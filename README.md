# ✨Parametrix✨


This repository implements an enhanced version of the Newton-Raphson Method (NRM) named Parametrix aimed at overcoming common convergence issues in nonlinear systems.

Traditional NRM can struggle with convergence when facing certain challenges, such as:

1. Presence of local extrema.
2. Poorly conditioned systems (e.g., parallel or nearly parallel planes).
3. Nearly intersecting planes that don’t actually meet.
4. Coincidence of the root with the first derivative.

To address these issues, this algorithm integrates two key strategies:

**Parametric Anchor (PA):** A large-magnitude anchor is embedded to make the linearized matrix diagonally dominant, facilitating better convergence. As iterations progress, PA is gradually diminished to refine the solution.
**Complex Numbers as Initial Guesses:** In cases of divergence, complex numbers are used as initial guesses, allowing the algorithm to explore smoother, alternative convergence paths and avoid zero Jacobian matrices.
These strategies have been tested on various nonlinear systems relevant to engineering and physics, including:

**1. Arrhenius chemical reactions**

The proposed approach significantly enhances the robustness of NRM, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers dealing with complex nonlinear systems.
